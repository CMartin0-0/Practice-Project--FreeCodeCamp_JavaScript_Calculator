# FreeCodeCamp - JavaScript Calculator

This repository contains my submission for the [FreeCodeCamp JavaScript Calculator project](https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/front-end-development-libraries/front-end-development-libraries-projects/build-a-javascript-calculator). The project demonstrates the ability to create a functional calculator using web technologies like TypeScript, JavaScript, CSS, and HTML. 

## Features

- **Basic Operations**: Addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.
- **Clear Functionality**: Reset the calculator to its initial state.
- **Chained Operations**: Perform multiple operations sequentially.
- **Responsive Design**: Works on both desktop and mobile devices.

## Technologies Used

- **TypeScript**: Main language for logic and functionality (81.8% of the codebase).
- **CSS**: Styles and layout (11.9% of the codebase).
- **JavaScript**: Supplementary scripting (3.4% of the codebase).
- **HTML**: Basic structure (2.9% of the codebase).
- **React**: Main JS Framework
- **Vite**: For building and development
